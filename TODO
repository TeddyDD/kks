- [x] kill cmd
- [x] edit cmd needs line:col support
- [x] grep cmd
- [x] find solution to remove the timeout in Get
	- [x] learned how channels work while doing this, implemented fsnotify
- [x] cat cmd, needs -b flag for specific buffer
- [ ] refactor cat cmd to use readTmp from Get
- [ ] ??? buflist should return relative to cwd
- [ ] kks-files from non-workdir doesn't work (need to resolve path before cmd.Edit()?)
- [ ] detach newly started sessions from shell (setsid?)

- add kks send commands in kks-select script to indicate highlighted client
- add '-a' flag to kill cmd for killing all sessions
