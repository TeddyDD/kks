- refactor Edit into smaller parts
	- move session creation into separate command that handles `setsid`
	- in edit without context, create new session and attach
	- resolve relative path before sending to kak


- [x] kill cmd
- [x] edit cmd needs line:col support
- [x] grep cmd
- [x] find solution to remove the timeout in Get
	- [x] learned how channels work while doing this, implemented fsnotify
- [x] cat cmd, needs -b flag for specific buffer
- [x] refactor cat cmd to use readTmp from Get
- [ ] make default cmd run edit, like kak
- [ ] need to be able to create new sessions easily
- [ ] ??? buflist should return relative to cwd
- [ ] kks-files from non-workdir doesn't work (need to resolve path before cmd.Edit()?)
- [ ] need separate kak connect command for gui programs (wofi/rofi/etc)



- add kks send commands in kks-select script to indicate highlighted client
- add '-a' flag to kill cmd for killing all sessions
